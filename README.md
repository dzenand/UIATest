Steps to reproduce the memory leak
1.	Run TestUIA_MemoryLeak app
2.	Run Twitter app, move mouse inside the app window, scroll it, click on it
3.	Close twitter app with cross I the right-up corner
4.	Run Facebook(fb) app, move mouse under fb app window, scroll content, click on posts
5.	Close fb app with cross I the right-up corner
6.	Run maps app, move mouse inside the app window, scroll around, and drag the content
7.	Close maps app with cross I the right-up corner
8.	Repeat last 6 steps in random order and after a while you will see that memory usage start growing

We have some assumption, that because when you close Modern UI app -> Win 8 instead of closing process suspends it and UIA cannot destroy it elements...


If we add dispose for UI elements and call Marshal.FinalReleaseComObject in it after a while AutomationElement.FromPoint returns only root window ( this is shown in TestUIA_StopAnswer app)
